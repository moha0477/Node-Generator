## Installation
  
In order to install this command-line application, clone this repository to your local drive and open it in VS Code or any editor of your choosing.

## Usage
  
In the terminal, enter npm init to initialize packages before installing all of the required ones. After that, install three npms: inquirer, fs, and util. You can then proceed to entering "node index.js" in the terminal; this will prompt a series of questions that will lead to the generation of the README.md file.
